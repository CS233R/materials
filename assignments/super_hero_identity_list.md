#Super hero Identity List

Create a list where you can add a Hero name, and their secret identity. You should be able to do the following:

- List all heroes (does not show their identity)
- List all heroes with secret identity (but requires you to enter a secret code of your choosing)
- Add new heroes
	- Hero name
	- secret_identity
	- Weakness

- Remove fallen heroes
- Does not need to be stored on the disk (you will have to add heroes everytime)

Bonus points:
Store the list of heroes in some form.

(challenges skills in, Arrays, Hashes, Methods, IRB, Looping, Comparators)
